## Python Calculator 🖩
Hey there! This is a simple command-line calculator I built using Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I used functions, loops, a dictionary for operations, and recursion to make it more flexible and interactive.

##  Features
✔️ Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
✔️ Allows continuous calculations using previous results
✔️ Handles division by zero errors (no crashing!)
✔️ Uses a dictionary to map operations (pretty cool, right?)
✔️ Lets you restart or start a new calculation easily

## 🛠 How to Use
Run the script using Python:
sh
Copy
Edit
python calculator.py
Enter the first number.
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
Enter the second number.
Continue calculating or start fresh!

## 🚀 Future Plans
I have a few ideas to make this calculator even better:
Add more advanced operations like square root and exponentiation
Improve input validation (so users can’t break it easily)

## 💡 Why I Built This
I made this project as part of my Python learning journey. It helped me understand functions, loops, recursion, and dictionaries better. Also, making something useful with code is always fun! 😃

## 📚 What I Learned
How to structure code using functions
How to use a dictionary for mapping operations
How to use recursion for restarting calculations
